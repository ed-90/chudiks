            <h3>STORYLINE</h3>

            <p>
                Far away from everyone and everything we know, among the woods and glades, lived the Chudiks. 
                They lived in a small forest called the Chudi-Forest. 
                <br><br>
                The "Chudi-Forest" was not a simple forest, it was saturated with incredible magic, at least that's what Chudiks thought, but in reality, there were just cannabis fields around the forest, which Chudiks enjoyed eating and smoking, they lived happily and did not know any trouble because most of the time they were high. 
                <br><br>
                After a while, bad times came, the rains were getting less and the weather was getting hotter and hotter, the reason for all this was global warming, which was happening gradually, but Chudiks didn't know that, so they became religious and believed that The God of Rain was just punishing them for smoking and eating too much cannabis.
                <br><br>
                At a certain point, when the forest and the hemp fields began to die, they decided that they must make sacrifices to The God of Rain, then maybe he would forgive them, and each of the Chudiks was willing to give his life without hesitation because they believed that after death they would reborn.
